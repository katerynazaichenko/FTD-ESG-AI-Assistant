We track progress through \nthe decarbonization index of our sales (life cycle carbon \nintensity of energy producs sold) \u20091. We have been leading \namong our peers in terms of actually achieving decarbon-\nization of the energy products sales mix since 2015. \nAs part of our contribution to the energy transition of our \nclients, we are thus developing activities in the production \nand sales of low-carbon electricity. We also produce and \nsell liquified natural gas, which is a necessary transition fuel \nfor building a reliable, low-carbon power system, comple -\nmenting renewable energies that are intermittent by nature. \nMoreover, gas helps to decarbonize power generation in \nmany countries, since burning gas rather than coal to \nproduce electricity emits half as much CO 2 for the same \namount of energy produced (see p.\u200944-45).\nIn this respect, setting objectives to drastically reduce  \nTotalEnergies’ global indirect emissions (Scope\xa03)\u20092 in abso-\nlute value, without an evolution of the overall structure of \nenergy demand, is in reality not relevant to reduce global \nGHG emissions.\nMost of the emissions reported under Scope\xa03 by Total-  \nEnergies correspond to the direct emissions (Scope\xa01) of \nthe consumers of these products: the use of these products \ndepends on their decisions and needs.\nIn this context, an absolute reduction target for Scope\xa03 for \na company like TotalEnergies, without any change in energy \nsystems and therefore without the reduction of the corre-\nsponding Scope\xa01 of energy users, would lead to a shift of \nthis demand towards other suppliers, notably the national oil \ncompanies of producing countries which account for more \nthan 70% of the world market (compared with around 1.5% \nfor TotalEnergies).\nThis strategy would have no effect on lowering global green-\nhouse gas emissions, and therefore no positive impact on \nclimate, and would be contrary to the interests of our \nCompany and its shareholders. \nThis strategy could be counter-productive for TotalEnergies’ \ncustomers, as the Company has set as a goal to ensure \ntheir energy supply security while supporting them in their \nown decarbonization journey.\nReminder: under Scope\xa03, since 2016 TotalEnergies has \nreported Category 11 emissions related to the end use by \nits customers of products sold i.e., linked to their combus-\ntion to obtain energy.\nSince 2023, TotalEnergies has published an estimate of indi-\nrect emissions related to the other Scope\xa03 categories, in \naccordance with the classification used by the GHG Protocol \nand Ipieca.
